All Futures is a landing page for Andrew 'Dee' Harding - a public servant and researcher working to make the unknown territory ahead of us a little bit better. They've developed forecasting algorithms for climate extremes and farming, conducted statistical assessments of Britain's levels of equality, and advised on the ethics of new technologies: working across public policy, socio-economic impacts, and the hard sciences for the last decade and a half. In each case, theyâ€™ve specialised in finding risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities to grasp the future. 

Dee also produces portfolio-resistant art and design around arcane uses of the internet, gives talks about mathematicians who were also wizards, plays cello pretty badly, and got paid to haunt the internet one time.
