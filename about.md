Dee Harding is technically friendly. In that they're technical, and also friendly. They bring academic rigour and a drive for well-crafted, robust regulation that is resolute, but charitable. They provide critical thinking about critical systems in a wide range of formats: having delivered national-scale research programmes for government, academia and private enterprise, and awkward questions, in generous terms, to a variety of audiences. Dee has worked in evidence-driven public policy, investigating socio-economic outcomes and impacts (resilience, equality, human rights), directly leveraging the hard sciences (advanced stats, computation, climatology). In each case, and for a multitude of applications, theyâ€™ve specialised in finding risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities to grasp the future. 

Dee dabbles in  portfolio-resistant art and design around arcane uses of the internet, give talks about mathematicians who were also wizards, plays cello pretty badly, and got paid to haunt the internet one time.
