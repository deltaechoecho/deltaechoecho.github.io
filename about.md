All Futures is written by Andrew (Dee) Harding.

I'm a public servant and researcher you could broadly call a geographer. I've developed forecasting algorithms for climate extremes and farming, conducted statistical assessments of Britain's levels of equality, and advised on the ethics and likely impacts of new technologies: working across public policy, socio-economic impacts, and the hard sciences for the last decade and a half. In each case, I’ve specialised in finding risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities to grasp the future. 

In my downtime I give talks about mathematicians who were also wizards, write for game design every now and then, play cello pretty badly, and produce portfolio-resistant art and design around arcane uses of the internet. I got paid to haunt the (German-speaking) internet one time. 

My (Québécois) French is alright, but my German is *extremely* bad.
