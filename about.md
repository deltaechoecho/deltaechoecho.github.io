Dee Harding is technically friendly. In that they're technical, but also friendly. They bring academic rigour and a drive for well-crafted, robust regulation that is resolute, but charitable. They provide critical thinking about critical systems in a wide range of formats: having delivered both national-scale research programmes and awkward questions, in generous terms, to a variety of audiences. Dee has worked in evidence-driven multi-national public policy, socio-economic outcomes and impacts (resilience, equality, human rights), and the hard sciences (advanced stats, computation, fluid dynamics). In each case, and for a multitude of applications, theyâ€™ve specialised in finding risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities to grasp the future.
