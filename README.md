Hello!

This website is lovingly powered by both Jekyll and the Dimension theme, with a couple of (very light) hacks made by yours truly. As long as you credit HTML5 UP (which is also the person behind Carrd.co! I should probably move over to it sometime!) and Andrew Banchich (love your work), per my footer, you can pretty much run off with all of the gubbins that make this site work. The text and photos are mine, but feel free to get in touch about re-use for the latter. Or prints, if you want them embiggenated.
