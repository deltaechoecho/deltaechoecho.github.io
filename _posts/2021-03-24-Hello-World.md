title: Changes ahead!
---

I've not had a proper blog of my own for a very long time. For the last 5 years I've either been contributing to institutional material, channeling that energy into rights-related work, or had my more interesting projects bound up in security issues. That's about to change- I'm taking up a new role in the not-very-distant future that's all about sharing, and being open, and collaborating with your peers, even in pretty stressful environments. 

Honestly, I couldn't be more thrilled. 

Not just because I'm desperately looking forward to finally talking about work with my friends over a pint, but because that work lines up with my values in a spectacular way. I love being part of a team. I genuinely believe that most of the world's modern and enduring problems can only be solved through co-operation. One of my favourite quotes of all time is the Margaret Mead one about a a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens. I love big-asks with no clear solution, and I love getting disparate people together to do good work and find surprising approaches. I'm also pretty fond of the fact that in 2021 my career has become more ridiculously on theme with William Gibson's cyberpunk than I could ever have possibly predicted. 

The new gig is very much a modern, enduring, digital problem. Very much with one of the best teams in the country. It's inarguably 'good work' by any possible definition. 

I'm not going to spoiler anyone just yet, but you can rest assured that when all the paperwork is filed and everything's firmly on course I am not going to *stop* talking about it.
